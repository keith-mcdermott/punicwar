        <section class="left-sidebar">The First Punic War ended in a Roman victory in 241 BC. After the war, Carthage expanded its holdings in Iberia, where in 219 BC a Carthaginian army under Hannibal sacked the pro-Roman city of Saguntum. In early 218 BC Rome declared war on Carthage, beginning the Second Punic War.<br><br>
        Hannibal surprised the Romans by marching his army overland from Iberia,and won crushing victories over the Romans at the battles of Trebia (218 BC), Lake Trasimene (217 BC), and Cannae (216 BC), where he annihilated the largest army the Romans had ever assembled.<br><br>
        The Roman commander Scipio invaded Carthaginian Africa in 204 BC, compelling the Carthaginian Senate to recall Hannibal's army from Italy. The final engagement of the war took place between armies under Scipio and Hannibal at Zama in 202 and resulted in Hannibal's defeat and in Carthage suing for peace. (Source: Wikipedia)
